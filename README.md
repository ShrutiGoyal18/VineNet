VINENET: GRAPE SEGMENTATION FOR SMARTER VINEYARD MANAGEMENT

Overview:
VineNet is an innovative deep-learning project aimed at revolutionizing vineyard management through grape segmentation in high-resolution images. By accurately segmenting grape bunches, VineNet enables vineyard owners to make informed decisions for better crop management.
